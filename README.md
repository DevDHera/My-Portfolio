# Portfolio of Devin

This is my personal portfolio to show off some of the works I have done and been doing throught my little developer life span. I begin programming about a year ago (2017) and been doing good since then.

When creating the portfolio I didn't want to just create a website. Instead I was keen on to creating this on RoR.

> My Portfolio is fully created using RoR 5

Apart from adding works I also included the following to portfolio website.

### Additional Features

- Action cable for real time chat.
- Multi user Blog space for anyone keen on spreading good to the world.
